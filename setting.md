#Liss's proposal

The game is set in an alternate universe Earth (we need a name for it should
that come up.)

The main hub settings are in a big city with a strong undercurrent of organized
crime, crooked cops, smugglers, city officials on the take, and normal people
caught in the middle, just trying to live their lives.

The gang war and many other things are being orchestrated by a secret cabal of
wizards who have their members in the top levels of everything.

The technology level is basically 1920s, but there are mad scientists building
advanced technology like robots.

###The City
This one needs a name. The city is a mashup of all the crime-ridden corrupt
cities of Prohibition. This would be the main hub. Sub-regions would include the
city hall, the gangster club, the Gatsby-style mansion, the research laboratory,
the sewers, and the cabal headquarters.

Adrian - Why not just have it be Chicago? We can take advantage of things in the actual city for plot and world and such.
